Andrei Dornik is currently an Associate Professor at the West University of Timișoara. He obtained a BSc in Geography and an MSc in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from the West University of Timișoara, and completed his PhD in Geography in 2016, with a thesis focused on digital soil mapping.

Andrei's research interests lie in the fields of Digital Soil Mapping, Pedometrics, and Soil Geography. He has a background in geoinformatics, applying advanced geospatial analysis techniques, spatial prediction methods, remote sensing approaches, and big data analytics to investigate and understand the dynamics of soil distribution, composition, and properties.

He has over 14 years of teaching and research experience, participating in and leading national and international research projects. As Principal Investigator, he led a national postdoctoral research grant developing innovative geospatial methodologies for land suitability assessment. As a postdoctoral researcher, he contributed to projects on spatio-temporal landscape analysis with remote sensing and landslide susceptibility mapping.

In parallel with his research activity, Andrei teaches courses in programming in GIS, geoinformatics, remote sensing, and digital mapping. He is an active member of the International Society for Geomorphometry (ISG).
