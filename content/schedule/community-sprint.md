**Dates: TBD**

FOSS4G Europe 2026 is planning to host the OSGeo community sprint.

Participation is free of charge and anyone involved or interested in getting
involved in OSGeo community projects is welcome.
**Lunch will be provided to the people taking part in the event!**

You can choose to contribute to one or more projects. The sky is the limit.
There’s always plenty to do - and it’s not all about programming. Translation,
documentation, feedback, discussions, and testing are very important for
projects! Conference registration is not a prerequisite for participation in
the community sprint.

Although participation in the sprint is free of charge, registration details will be published closer to the event.
