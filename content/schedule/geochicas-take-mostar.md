## GeoChicas event (TBD)

GeoChicas are an international women’s mapping community with members in more
than 12 different countries. Our aim is for women to have a greater presence and
participation in key OSM events, increase female participation and leadership,
and work on mapping projects which benefit women. Our main focus as a group is
to help close the gender gap in the OSM community across participation, data
creation and curation.

Everyone is welcome to join the GeoChicas event.

This is an event to meet other women and allies attending FOSS4G Europe who are interested in closing the gender gap and working towards
diversity in our communities. **The first hour is only for women and people
identifying as women but afterwards, everyone is welcome!**

More details will be published closer to the event.
