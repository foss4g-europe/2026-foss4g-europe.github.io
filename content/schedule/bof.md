**Thursday (2 July), Friday (3 July) 2026 (proposed)**  
Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are unstructured timeslots where people can
self-organise themselves to discuss topics of interest. So, if there are any
specific topics you'd like to discuss face-to-face with other people this is
exactly the chance.

BoF's can be held in BoF rooms at specified timeslots or taken off-site for
breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

The FOSS4G Europe conference provides the BoF rooms. Details on how to register and propose BoFs will be published closer to the event.

We will try to keep up and add the ones taking place during the allocated time
slots also to [**the schedule**](/schedule/talks/)
to give a better overview of the discussions that are taking place.
