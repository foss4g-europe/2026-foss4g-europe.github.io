It’s incredible to witness random acts of kindness — people giving 
generously for the good of the community.

We are deeply grateful to everyone who chose to participate in this
year’s [**Adopt-a-ticket**](../../registration/adopt-a-ticket/)program.
By covering the cost of tickets for workshop instructors, travel grant
recipients, you’ve helped make FOSS4G Europe 2026
more inclusive, diverse, and accessible.

These gestures remind us what open 
source is really about — people supporting people.

Thank you for being part of that spirit.
