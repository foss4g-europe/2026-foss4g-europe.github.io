TomTom N.V., an Amsterdam-based Dutch multinational, specializes in location
technology and consumer electronics. Founded in 1991, TomTom revolutionized
the consumer satellite navigation market in 2004 with its first all-in-one
portable device. Today, it's a leading provider of accurate **maps**, **real-time
traffic**, and **navigation** solutions for consumers and enterprises, including
the automotive sector, while actively innovating in areas like **autonomous**
driving.

TomTom is involved with the Open Maps communities and societies in general and
in particular the **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** project, both as a significant
data user and an active community supporter. Since 2021, TomTom has improved
OSM data across over 200 countries through organized editing and integrated
OSM data into its new map products in 2023. As the first **Platinum corporate
member** of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF), TomTom provides substantial
financial contributions. The company also participates in OSM working groups,
serves on the OSMF Advisory Board, sponsors numerous OSM events, and fosters
new mapping communities globally, thereby enhancing OSM data quality and
strengthening the open mapping community.
