# Call for sponsors

<br/>
The Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe conference 
is the premier gathering of the OSGeo European community. This week-long event
 brings together geospatial professionals, developers, and enthusiasts for an engaging 
program that includes two days of hands-on workshops, three days of insightful presentations,

FOSS4GE 2026 will be an in-person event but we are working hard to make realtime
streaming of all presentations in addition to recorded material which
will later be published.
