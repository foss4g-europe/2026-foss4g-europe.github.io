Evelyn is a geographer by heart and Professor in Geoinformatics in University
of Tartu. She holds a MSc in geoinformatics and PhD in landscape ecology and
environmental protection, and is developing the Landscape Geoinformatics
working group as a necessity to improve and strengthen environmental
geoinformatics capabilities at the university and for Estonia in general
through leading national and international research projects. Her research
interests evolve around the interactions of land use/land cover and water
quality, landscape changes and geospatial modelling with machine learning.
She is also interested in geospatial visualisation.
