<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe is the European
flagship event of <a href="https://osgeo.org"><strong>OSGeo</strong></a> - an open, grassroots and
dynamic community. We are
looking for novel and original submissions on development, use, and advocacy
for FOSS4G over a wider array of topics ranging from state-of-software to
specific use cases, from building and sustaining an inclusive community to
running a successful business around FOSS4G technology, from software technical
details to democratic processes and policy making.</p>
<p>Whether you are a seasoned FOSS4Ger or it is your first time presenting, we
welcome all contributions - the conference and the FOSS4G community at large
flourishes on knowledge and experience shared by diverse voices.</p>
<p>As this is the European regional OSGeo event we are in particular seeking to
create dialogue and discussion on developments, opportunities and challenges
for the European OSGeo community. As we live in an interconnected world, we
are also eager to give space to learning from global perspectives and foster
exchange going beyond European borders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please keep in mind this is a Free and Open Source Software conference.
Submissions promoting restricted license / closed source software will not be
accepted.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="session-types">Session types</h2>
<p>A <strong>regular talk</strong> is allocated to a 30 minute slot:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 minutes for the talk,</li>
<li>5 minutes for questions and answers, and</li>
<li>5 minutes for the participants to change rooms and next speaker setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>lightning talk</strong> is a 5 minute speaker slot, with</p>
<ul>
<li>4 minutes for the talk, and</li>
<li>1 minute for the next speaker setup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a proposal</h2>
<h3 id="general-topics">General topics</h3>
<p>When submitting your talk, you will be asked to select one general topic that
best defines your contribution. This will help us group similar-themed talks
into tracks.</p>
<h4 id="state-of-software">State of software</h4>
<p>Recent developments in Free and Open Source Software projects. Maybe tease
the audience with a sneak-peek of what’s to come in a release later in the
year? Also use this opportunity to inform fellow maintainers about changes to come.</p>
<h4 id="open-data">Open Data</h4>
<p>Open source software often goes hand-in-hand with open data. Are you using
Open Data to build something? Or better yet, are you producing Open Data?
A dataset we haven’t heard about? A solution to accessing, storing or
archiving open data? Excellent! We are all eager to find out about it, to
make decision making processes more transparent and democratic.</p>
<h4 id="open-standards-and-interoperability-across-geospatial">Open standards and interoperability across geospatial</h4>
<p>Open standards and best-practices help us to be interoperable. They help us
share and consume data and integrate software solutions. What are emerging
best-practices that could be integrated into a standard? How did you improve
interoperability across geospatial computing, i.e. Julia, Python, R or other
projects? Or maybe you have thoughts on implementing INSPIRE services? Or
maybe you are building something pan-European on top of INSPIRE? Updates on
the European Union Location Framework ( EULF) Blueprint?</p>
<h4 id="foss4g-made-in-europe">FOSS4G “Made in Europe”</h4>
<p>A special track co-organized with the European Commission to investigate and
introduce the many Free and Open Source software tools, data capture and
collection and sharing projects carried out
at the European Commission, European institutions or funded by them.</p>
<h4 id="open-community">Open community</h4>
<p>How do you engage people? What project governance models have helped you
foster an inclusive community? What makes people want to contribute, and be
part of the community. Maybe your local OSGeo chapter? A software user-group?
Or maybe you’ve participated in a mapathon and want to share your thoughts.
This is most suitable for sharing experiences so we could all grow as
individuals and build and sustain our communities better. Sharing is caring.</p>
<h4 id="foss4g-in-education-and-research">FOSS4G in education and research</h4>
<p>Are you an educator? And you are making your students use Free and Open
Source Software? Perfect! We’d like to hear from you how you have managed that.
What is the reaction of students? How do you engage them and how do you
introduce them to the wonderful world of Free and Open Source Software and
the communities that surround them?</p>
<h4 id="building-a-business-with-foss4g">Building a business with FOSS4G</h4>
<p>You have built a business around supporting and maintaining a FOSS4G solution.
This approach shifts the focus to collaboration, transparency and
community-driven innovation, setting it apart from the traditional
closed-source business model. How do you manage that? What challenges have you
faced? What unique advantages has this path brought to your business and your
clients?</p>
<h4 id="transition-to-foss4g">Transition to FOSS4G</h4>
<p>Do you have a success story to share about transitioning a system or workflow
to FOSS4G technology? Maybe some lessons-learnt? We would like to hear about
it, and have you share your experiences with the rest of the community.</p>
<h4 id="use-cases-and-applications">Use cases and applications</h4>
<p>You have a very specific use case of doing things with Free and Open Source
Software. Maybe you’re leveraging it for spatial or urban planning, optimizing
land use and improving spatial decision-making processes? Maybe you work with
FOSS4G for AI to do Earth Observation? Or maybe routing? Farming a flock of
drones? Making sense of a gazillion points in space and time? Something
completely different that we didn’t even imagine Free and Open Source Software
could be used for? Maybe you have a successful use case aiding this year’s host
country? We are all eager to find novel and interesting ways of solving
geospatial puzzles, and to make existing workflows smoother. Something will
click in the audience’s heads after hearing your talk.</p>
<h3 id="general-theme">General theme</h3>
<p>In addition you’ll be asked to provide at least one general theme (think of
this as a keyword) to describe your submission. You can choose between
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data access, collection &amp; sharing</li>
<li>Data processing and analysis</li>
<li>Spatial machine learning</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
<li>State of software, or new features</li>
<li>Business &amp; FOSS4G</li>
<li>FOSS4G at governmental institutions</li>
<li>FOSS4G and sustainable development goals (SDG)</li>
<li>FOSS4G for movement, transport, and networks. In space and time, by any
subject (water, asphalt, people, birds, animals, air, or even cosmos)</li>
<li>FOSS4G for crisis / disaster response, civil defence</li>
<li>FOSS4G for land use planning, land management, monitoring, smart cities,
population mapping</li>
<li>FOSS4G for ocean / marine monitoring</li>
<li>Drones, sensors, lasers, and remote sensing</li>
<li>FOSS4G for agriculture</li>
<li>FOSS4G and environmental observations</li>
<li>IoT, indoor mapping</li>
<li>Standards, SDI, INSPIRE, interoperability</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Community building and participatory FOSS4G</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-complexity">Technical complexity</h3>
<p>And finally we would like to ask you to identify the level of technical
complexity of your presentation in a 3-point scale ranging from
“no previous knowledge needed” to “must be a superexpert to understand”.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<p>There are no formal indications when preparing your contribution for the
conference, but please consider the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOSS4G is - first and foremost - about open source, so make sure you
clearly indicate which projects are essential in your talk</li>
<li>If your talk is about developments in or a completely new project,
please point to the appropriate repository (or repositories)</li>
<li>Your talk would not be about development of software? Yes! Although
software development is in the heart of FOSS4G it is not the only purpose of
the conference. The goal is to bring together developers and users, policy
makers and open community advocates over the broad sphere of geospatial to
share experiences and showcase the power and reach of free and open source
software.</li>
<li>Although we expect many different languages to be present at the conference,
the working language for the event is English.</li>
<li>The more suitable the selection of topic, theme and technical complexity are,
the better shaped the final program will be. So, please, help us optimize your
time and make the best out of the conference.</li>
<li>Although we are working hard to provide you with good internet connectivity
at the venue, please don’t rely solely on it during your presentation.
Things tend to break exactly at the moment of live demonstrations.</li>
<li>We believe in equality, therefore please keep in mind the talk slot lengths
when preparing your presentation. But at the same time be prepared that the
hallway discussions on your presentation might continue until the early hours
of the morning.</li>
<li>FOSS4G is an open community of people from various, diverse backgrounds and
lived experiences. This is what makes us strong and we care for each other’s
well-being. Please keep in mind that a derogatory attitude towards other
people or their work is not welcome.</li>
<li>We are working on making streaming of presentations a reality, however
the conference presenters would be expected to be on-site</li>
<li>And lastly, the success of this event lies in the responsible actions of
all participants and organizers alike. If you have confirmed your participation
but later on you or none of the co-authors are no longer able to present,
please let us know as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selection-process">Selection process</h2>
<p>FOSS4G Europe is a community event and therefore the selection of talks will
be predominantly based on an open community voting process. The highest-scoring
talks will automatically be included in the program, while others will be
reviewed by the volunteer <a href="/program-committee/"><strong>Program Committee</strong></a>.</p>
<p>We will make sure that the conference program will be well-balanced and diverse.
Moreover, the Program Committee will work hard to ensure that every OSGeo
project has its proper representation. If you are part of some FOSS4G project
and want to propose a special session, contact us at
<a href="mailto:info-europe@foss4g.org"><strong>info-europe@foss4g.org</strong></a> to make sure we
consider the proposal carefully.</p>
